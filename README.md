# AlphaLight_Updated
AlphaLight, as originally created with Neurol, but reimplemented to use pylsl instead. 

This code  is designed to run with a Muse, but it can be modified to use any EEG device, the channel numbers will have to be changed. 

To setup a stream that pylsl can connect to, we suggest using BlueMuse or Muselsl.
